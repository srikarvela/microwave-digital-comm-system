# Modulation Scheme

The system employs a digital phase modulation scheme, such as Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) or Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), due to its robustness and analytical tractability in noise-limited microwave communication systems.

In phase-based modulation, digital symbols are mapped to distinct phase states of a carrier waveform. This approach provides strong immunity to amplitude noise and is commonly used in microwave and RF communication links where power efficiency and reliability are critical.

BPSK offers maximum robustness against noise at the expense of spectral efficiency, while QPSK improves spectral efficiency by transmitting two bits per symbol with a modest reduction in noise tolerance. The selected modulation scheme reflects a practical tradeoff between error performance and bandwidth utilization.

These modulation formats are well-suited for analytical BER derivation, enabling direct comparison between theoretical predictions and simulation results. This alignment is essential for validating system-level behavior and reinforcing fundamental digital communication principles.
